# Currency Exchange Project

This Currency Exchange project is designed to provide you with real-time currency exchange rates and currency conversion functionality.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

1. **CurrencyExchange.Server**: This is the server-side component of the application. It handles the backend logic, including fetching and serving currency data and exchange rates from external sources.
